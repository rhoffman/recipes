 Whiskey Cake                                 350*60min.
 1 box yellow cake mix       1 box vanilla pudding                     
  4 eggs                                1 cup milk
  1/3 cup oil                          1 cup chopped nuts
  glaze:    melt don't boil
  1/4 lb. butter ,   1 cup sugar, 1/2 cup whiskey
   
       Beat all except nuts 5 min.  Flour nuts then add
       to batter.  Bake at 350* for 60 min. (check at 55 min.).
       Remove when cake springs back.
       When cake comes out of the oven pour 1/2 glaze
       over cake in pan.   In 25 min. take cake out of pan and
       pour remaining glaze over top.
       (a guess to make more like Helen's: 1/2 cup milk
       and 1/2 cup whiskey in the batter?)
