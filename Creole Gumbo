40 minute cook time. Add Sausage half way. Shrimp at end.

For a deep, dark roux in half the time, heat the oil before adding the flour. Add the roux to room-temperature fish stock (made from shrimp and clam juice) to prevent separating. Use plenty of garlic, dried thyme, and bay leaves but just 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper. Add generous amounts of smoked sausage and shrimp, and finish with parsley and scallions.
